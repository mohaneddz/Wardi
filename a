🚀 **Exciting News: Introducing Wardi! 🌟**

I’m thrilled to announce the launch of **Wardi**, my first full-stack project designed to elevate the way we engage with the **Quran**, **Hadith**, and **Tafsir**! This project has been a personal journey to sharpen my web development skills while building something I can use every day.

✨ **What's Wardi?**
Wardi is a modern, minimalistic platform that offers seamless access to Quranic, Hadith, and Tafsir content. Whether you're exploring by verse, chapter, or section, Wardi is here to enhance your reading experience across all your devices.

🎯 **The Inspiration**: I wanted to motivate myself to read more Quran by creating a platform with a beautiful interface and bookmarking system—something that speaks to me personally.

🔒 **Features**:
- Access to **Quran**, **Hadith**, and **Tafsir** in both **Arabic** and **English**.
- **Personalized bookmarks** and cloud sync for progress tracking across devices.
- **Secure user profiles** with customizable settings.
- **Responsive design** for a smooth experience on any device.
- **Multilingual support** (with more languages coming soon!).

🔮 **Future Plans**:
- Expanding to **French**, **Urdu**, and **Malay**.
