    Welcome to Wardi! üåü
</h1>


## Introduction

In celebration of the arrival of the Prophet's birthday (Mawlid al-Nabi). I have decided to share my latest Web-Dev Project, **Wardi!**

Wardi is a modern and minimalistic platform designed to enrich your spiritual journey through an enhanced experience of exploring **Quran**, **Hadith**, and **Tafsir**. Blending cutting-edge technology with a spiritual focus, Wardi offers a personalized and seamless reading experience, complete with cloud sync and an intuitive user interface that adapts to all your devices. Whether you‚Äôre at home or on the go, Wardi ensures that your connection to these sacred texts remains uninterrupted.

**Accessible At:**  [Wardi's Official Website](https://wardi.onrender.com)

## The Idea 

**The Concept:** I wanted to make an interactive website to sharpen my Web-Dev Skills as a **first project**, and I wanted it to be something that I see myself using everyday, which lead me to making a website for reading Quran, Hadith, Tafsir, with a beatiful interface, bookmarking capabilities, to **motivate myself for reading the quran even more!**, by something I specifically built by my own hands.

**The Name "Wardi:"** was illustrated from the word **ŸàŸêÿ±ŸíÿØ** (wird) which refers to the daily amount of quran a person reads, and to take it even further, I made the website 's primary font **Pink!** which is a Synonyme to the website's name in arabic

## Features

## Technologies Used üõ†Ô∏è

- **HTML**: For structuring the website's content.
- **CSS**: To define the design and layout.
- **SASS**: For better style management, utilizing variables, mixins, and functions.
- **JavaScript**: Responsible for handling the platform's interactivity.
- **Node.js**: Powers the server-side logic and handles data processing.
- **Express.js**: Provides a robust back-end framework for handling routes and middleware.
- **Pug**: Used as a templating engine for rendering dynamic HTML pages more efficiently.

## How to Use Wardi üìÉ
**You can do so by visiting the ofiicial website deployed at https://wardi.onrender.com with render**
- active 24/7 using **Daemon pings***  
- it uses both the free plan of MongoDB & Render, which might slow down the user experience

## Constraints, Known Issues & Future Plans üöß

### Constraints
- **Free Plan Limitations**: Wardi is currently using free tiers for both **MongoDB** and **Render**, which can lead to slower performance during peak usage or when the platform is idle for extended periods. The platform relies on **Daemon pings** to stay active and has great optimizations, but this may still cause occasional downtime.
- **Limited Languages**: At the moment, Wardi only supports **Arabic** and **English** languages. that is because adding more languages just means spending more time doing the tasks as before which contradicts my goal of learning by making this project. Hoever, adding more languages support is still possible if I recieve requests for it.

### Known Issues
- **Performance Delays**: Some users may experience slower load times or occasional lags when syncing data across devices due to free hosting limitations.
- **Email Delivery**: During heavy traffic, emails for password recovery or verification may take longer to arrive, potentially affecting the registration process, which might take up to a minute of delay maximum.
- **Potential bugs or visual inconsistencies**: Due to the limited time making this website, and how flexible and ever changing the layouts are, it is possible to encounter bugs, mostly just visual ones.

### Future Plans
- **Premium Hosting Upgrade**: We plan to move Wardi to premium hosting solutions if requested, to address performance and uptime issues. This will ensure faster response times and a more reliable service.
- **Dark Mode / White Mode**: Although it's quite easy, I just didn't want to implement it yet, as I did a harder task in my past [Pomodoro](https://github.com/mohaneddz/BreezePomodoro) project, so it won't bring that much of a learning value to my project
- **Delete My Account**: Quite an easy thing to do, If users request so do so, I will add this feature in a way that is similiar to the way you delete all bookmarks

We welcome feedback from the community to further identify issues and prioritize new features.

### Potential Plans
- **Expanded Language Support**: By adding **French**, **Urdu**, and **Malay** and to Wardi's supported languages.
- **Mobile App Development**: To launch dedicated **iOS** and **Android** apps, optimized for mobile devices, offering a smoother experience.
